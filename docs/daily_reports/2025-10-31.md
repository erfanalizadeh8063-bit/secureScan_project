# SecuraScan — Smoke Test (2025-10-31)

## URLs
- Backend: https://securascan-back-dd57.onrender.com
- Frontend: https://securascan-front-dd57.onrender.com

## Results (live check 2025-10-31)
- GET /healthz → 200 ✅
- GET /api/does-not-exist → 404 (expected) ✅
- OPTIONS /api/scan/demo (Origin=FRONT_URL) → 200; Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://securascan-front-dd57.onrender.com; methods present; allow-credentials: true ✅
- Front page (FRONT_URL) → 200 ✅

## Env (Render)
- BACK: RUST_LOG=info, BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080, ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://securascan-front-dd57.onrender.com
- FRONT: VITE_API_BASE=https://securascan-back-dd57.onrender.com

## Notes
- Build logs summary: Frontend currently serves bundles that do NOT contain the baked BACK_URL; likely VITE_API_BASE was not injected at build time or an old cached artifact is being served.
- Bundles inspected:
	- https://securascan-front-dd57.onrender.com/assets/index-CYFl9N-R.js -> MISSING BACK_URL
	- https://securascan-front-dd57.onrender.com/index-CYFl9N-R.js -> MISSING BACK_URL
- Branch with Docker ARG change: `chore/fe-build-arg-vite` (commit present) — `secureScan_Front/Dockerfile.frontend` now accepts `ARG VITE_API_BASE` and sets `ENV VITE_API_BASE` before building.
- Next: Clear frontend build cache on Render, set `VITE_API_BASE=https://securascan-back-dd57.onrender.com`, and click "Clear build cache & Deploy" for the `securascan-front-dd57` service.
