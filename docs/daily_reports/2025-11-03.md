# SecuraScan — Daily Report (Nov 3, 2025)

## High-Level Summary
- CI unified: Only one clean main workflow (`securascan.yml`) remains active.
- CodeQL hardened: upgraded to v3, `languages: auto`, `queries: security-extended`, and made the security job non-blocking.
- Cleanup & docs: removed corrupted workflows and added `ci_cleanup_report.md`.

## Key Actions
- Replaced/added: `securascan.yml` — two jobs (security + build-and-scan).
- Removed from repo: `securascan-clean.yml`, `securascan-fixed.yml`.
- CodeQL changes in `securascan.yml`:
  - `init`: `github/codeql-action/init@v3` with `languages: auto`, `queries: security-extended`
  - `autobuild`: `github/codeql-action/autobuild@v3`
  - `analyze`: `github/codeql-action/analyze@v3`
  - Added `continue-on-error: true` at job level
  - Kept the PR guard that skips security job for forked PRs

## Git Activity
- Branch: `chore/frontend-nginx-port`
- Example commit messages:
  - `ci: replace corrupted workflow with clean securascan.yml (security + build)`
  - `ci: CodeQL v3, JS-only init, security job non-blocking`
  - `ci: CodeQL init use auto languages; ensure v3`
- Push succeeded and remote branch updated.

## Validation
- Single authoritative workflow: ✅
- CodeQL updated to v3: ✅
- `languages: auto` + `security-extended`: ✅
- YAML validated locally: ✅
- Security job non-blocking and PR guard intact: ✅

## Next Step
- Manually trigger the workflow from GitHub Actions (Run workflow on branch `chore/frontend-nginx-port`)
  or push a small dummy commit to verify CodeQL/SARIF and gitleaks on a non-fork run.
